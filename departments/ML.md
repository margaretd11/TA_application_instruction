> 1. Students fill out this application form and express their preferences by ranking courses.

> 3. The MLD TA Coordinator finalizes the TA assignments based on instructor and TA applicant preferences, with the goal of meeting the needs of all our courses, while giving as many applicants and instructors their top choices as possible. This has two key implications: First, you may be assigned to any MLD course for which we believe you are qualified. Second, it is in your best interest to rank all the courses you are qualified for.
